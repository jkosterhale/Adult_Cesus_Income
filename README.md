## Introduction
**That's the exploration on the dataset from the census bureau database with Jupyter Notebook**

## Data Analysis
### Explore Categorical Data 
**The completed code of that part is in DataAnalysis.ipynb. In fact, I use R add column name for each variable and find the missing data.
At the first time, we explore the categoric variables with ploting the distribution of different value for each variable. We can easily
find the percent of every value existed in the whole dataset. In fact, the missing data is presneted by "?" , we can also get their percents 
from graphs. And we also know that the missing data exist only in the follow variables : So we found missing data in GRINST, MIGMTR1, MIGMTR3, 
MIGMTR4, MIGSUN, PEFNTVTY, PEMNTVTY, PENATVTY. For example, the missing rate of MIGMTR1 is 49.97% which is a little large for the dataset.**
